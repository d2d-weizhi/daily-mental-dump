# My Mic Drop Moment After 20 Years

## Mid-day Mental Dump

- I've just had the most incredible, and honestly mind-blowing morning in over 20 years. Wait, did I just say that? Yes, most mind-blowing experience in **OVER 20 YEARS**. Just let it sink in for a minute.
- This morning, after I woke up, I saw this post that Dan Maccarone has published on UX Collective, and I discovered that I had been featured on one of the **Top Central Voices in the UX Industry**. Not just regionally, or nationally, but globally. Now, don't minimize it. It is what it is. Embrace it.
- Even though I tried to write something over breakfast, honestly I was still waking up and I didn't have all of the right words to craft a proper LinkedIn post.
- As I took the time this morning to unpack what I have been experiencing since last night, I came a personal revelation that this constant need I used to have to chase after a goal, or a destination of who I wanted to be, I've just become that person. I have been that person every single day. I was just too close to the daily action and struggles to really see it that way.
- Suddenly, a light bulb went off in my head. I knew in that moment that I no longer have anything to prove, either to myself or to anybody else.
- I no longer need a KPI or checklist of things I must achieve in order to reach the "ultimate goal" of who I wanted to become.
- I am that guy.

### Becoming the BEST VERSIONS of Myself in Every Situation

- By learning to see that each side of me has a unique and powerful talent, it also made me realize that when I embrace all of me and not just a part of myself, I get to be the **BEST VERSIONS** of myself in every single possible situation. I just never gave them the chance that they deserved.

### BEST LINKEDIN POST OF ALL TIME

- When I was walking over to the library, I remembered something that I had posted onto my feed last night. In what I would only describe as the most vulnerable state I've been in:
> **_In my most vulnerable moment, I wrote a post asking God for help. I admitted that after so long of persevering and feeling alone, I felt like I was going to fall apart under the weight of everything that I've been struggling with. So I asked Him for a sign, something undeniable._**
- When I finally remembered that this morning, I instantly recognized that what Dan has done was essentially the biggest neon sign from God, telling me that I've basically already arrived. I am right where I needed to be.
- And so, for the first time in 20 years, I finally decided to let that PR side of me go wild. No holds barred writing. And I ended up writing my best LinkedIn post of all time.
- The post covered 4 things:
  - What it has been like being considered an outsider in the UX industry.
  - What it felt like to have to do things my own because I believed that just because something worked doesn't mean it is the best way. Nobody would believe me, follow me or wanted to help me. _Thinking back now, I get that sense that they didn't want to help because they were afraid that they might be associated with failure._
  - Being told by many that I don't belong in the industry because "I was never really one of them to begin with".
  - Because of how radically the industry is shifting right now, suddenly, my radical views and methods of looking at UX has become not just useful, but necessary.
  - I even dropped a comment of my prayer from last night.
- I am really looking forward to enjoying some pasta today.
