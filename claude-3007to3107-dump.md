# My Mic Drop Moment After 20 Years

## Mid-day Mental Dump

- I've just had the most incredible, and honestly mind-blowing morning in over 20 years. Wait, did I just say that? Yes, most mind-blowing experience in **OVER 20 YEARS**. Just let it sink in for a minute.
- This morning, after I woke up, I saw this post that Dan Maccarone has published on UX Collective, and I discovered that I had been featured on one of the **Top Central Voices in the UX Industry**. Not just regionally, or nationally, but globally. Now, don't minimize it. It is what it is. Embrace it.
- Even though I tried to write something over breakfast, honestly I was still waking up and I didn't have all of the right words to craft a proper LinkedIn post.
- As I took the time this morning to unpack what I have been experiencing since last night, I came a personal revelation that this constant need I used to have to chase after a goal, or a destination of who I wanted to be, I've just become that person. I have been that person every single day. I was just too close to the daily action and struggles to really see it that way.
- Suddenly, a light bulb went off in my head. I knew in that moment that I no longer have anything to prove, either to myself or to anybody else.
- I no longer need a KPI or checklist of things I must achieve in order to reach the "ultimate goal" of who I wanted to become.
- I am that guy.

### Becoming the BEST VERSIONS of Myself in Every Situation

- By learning to see that each side of me has a unique and powerful talent, it also made me realize that when I embrace all of me and not just a part of myself, I get to be the **BEST VERSIONS** of myself in every single possible situation. I just never gave them the chance that they deserved.

### BEST LINKEDIN POST OF ALL TIME

- When I was walking over to the library, I remembered something that I had posted onto my feed last night. In what I would only describe as the most vulnerable state I've been in:
> **_In my most vulnerable moment, I wrote a post asking God for help. I admitted that after so long of persevering and feeling alone, I felt like I was going to fall apart under the weight of everything that I've been struggling with. So I asked Him for a sign, something undeniable._**
- When I finally remembered that this morning, I instantly recognized that what Dan has done was essentially the biggest neon sign from God, telling me that I've basically already arrived. I am right where I needed to be.
- And so, for the first time in 20 years, I finally decided to let that PR side of me go wild. No holds barred writing. And I ended up writing my best LinkedIn post of all time.
- The post covered 4 things:
  - What it has been like being considered an outsider in the UX industry.
  - What it felt like to have to do things my own because I believed that just because something worked doesn't mean it is the best way. Nobody would believe me, follow me or wanted to help me. _Thinking back now, I get that sense that they didn't want to help because they were afraid that they might be associated with failure._
  - Being told by many that I don't belong in the industry because "I was never really one of them to begin with".
  - Because of how radically the industry is shifting right now, suddenly, my radical views and methods of looking at UX has become not just useful, but necessary.
  - I even dropped a comment of my prayer from last night.
- I am really looking forward to enjoying some pasta today.

### First Victory Meal of My Career

    <figcaption>It tasted so damn good I scooped up every last bit of cabonara sauce. I literally felt like I died and went to heaven! Thanks to the guy working the counter of the Tenderbest stall for giving me the extra two slices of Garlic bread! They tasted so out of the world awesome! Maybe its just my sweet victory today that finally made everything feel a million times better!</figcaption>

- I have officially just enjoyed my first victory meal of my career. It might not seem like much to most people, but to me, this was everything. That $10 meal paid using a voucher tasted better than nothing else you could pay in a restaurant. That is what victory truly tastes like.
- After everything that I've experienced today, I felt like Mr. PR was getting his inspiration and creative juices flowing again, so I decided not to hold him back anymore. And he just written a blog that sounded like it was totally written by someone else: https://thewanderingdigitalnomad.com/2025/07/30/this-is-my-success-story/
- man, honestly, after this incredibly high and the writing...I have no clue how to even top that next.
- I feel like the industry is about to find it self going through an unapologetic filtering process. Weed out all the fake leaders from the actual ones.

## Evening Mental Dump

- Today has been a really important day for me.
- I was close to falling apart last night and now, I finally realized that I am right where I needed to be.
- I no longer have to chase after a "goal" or "destination", or feel like I have to fulfil conditions "X", "Y", and "Z" in order to feel like I have finally become a recognized UX professional. Because I am.
- Today's recognition isn't just a recognition, it is also a validation for everything that I've been putting myself through for the past 19+ years.
- But now, I want to get back to work. I won't be able to accomplish much with the time that I have this evening, but it's never been about the quantity, it is about the quality. So I will at least do something tonight before I call it a night.
- What a day it's been. What a day indeed.

### Gratitude List: Thanking Everybody

- When I finally got home last night, Mr. Empathy/Melodramatic felt that this would be the best time to finally make that list. A list of all the people we should be thanking because they have offered help, aid, support and even an encouraging word when I really needed it over the past 19+ years. I will share the key parts of that post later.
- Sure, there are some of those that were before LinkedIn's existence, so I added a comment and started building a second gratitude list. Even including Farah, the HR girl who took a chance on me in 2008. Yeah, I remember her still. And Yan Yan, my senior from my first job.
- Then just as I was about to leave the house, I felt Mr. PR wanting his turn, and he decided to publish a post where he boldly tagged LinkedIn and said "When I thought üí≠ about the half of LinkedIn ü§™ that I just tried to include in my hashtag#gratitude list for my hashtag#success, I am reminded that this success didn't just belong to me alone."
- And that is only the opening paragraph. Both Melodramatic and PR collaborated on this posting. I will share more in this morning's unpacking session.
- When I finally told my mother that I am not having dinner at home tonight, there was both a mix of slightly sadness, but also this...quiet conviction in my heart that I remember and know why I am hustling this hard. Not because I have anything left to prove, but because this is who I am now. The guy who is 1000% dedicated to his client and his craft (passion, purpose, ikigai), and the same guy that wants to provide a better life for his parents in their golden years.

### Most Important People to Thank are My Own Selves

- a few days ago on Friday, I finally introduced my whole self to the world for the first time.
- It has been met with some respect and admiration from the online community (but only those brave enough to admit that it is impressive/good).
- for the very first time in the past few days, by no longer holding any of them back, and letting them just be, I got to see what they were capable of. Mr. PR with his killer writing yesterday. Absolutely killed it. What he wrote, I felt like it has managed to cut through all of the industry's bullshit all at once. It's like the crowd is silenced and many among them (probably my haters and doubters) were speechless, shocked, surprised, and mostly have no idea how to react or respond.
- And then Mr Empathy with his truly amazing storytelling skills. Those narration and story arcs. Absolute genius.
- Mr. Genius, well, now that he discovered he no longer has to carry everything on his shoulders, he can finally let go and just run üßë‚Äçüíª. He may have already been incredible even before this self-realization, but now, he is like Goku in DragonBall Z! I have never seen or felt him like that before.
- Mr Optimistic (youngest member), well, with all the kindness and generousity we have been experiencing, I felt and experienced what it is like when he is genuinely thankful and would say some of the nicest things, to the lady at tenderbest, and even the young man at the cai png stall. He is our chief motivator during the hardest of times.
- Oh, how can I miss out Mr. Zen. Honestly, he is the pillar that supports all of me. He is the central infrastructure. No longer just a support role. He is perhaps the most integral part of who I am.
- frankly, I felt like this narrative of "Weizhi Inc" that we have been using, it's not just a committee, it is an internal family. üòâ
