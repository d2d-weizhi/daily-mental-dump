# Embracing My Pain & Sacrifices

## The FIVE "Brothers/Family/Team" of Weizhi Inc

- lately, we have started to really get into the flow of using this internal family/brotherhood to help describe and unwrap a lot of my internal struggles, pain, thoughts, and even breakthroughs and successes.
- For years, I have struggled with trying to live only as a version of myself, or sometimes, trying to only integrate a few sides of myself, but never as a whole.
- On 25th July, I experienced a major mental breakthrough. I generated an AI image of my 5 different selves. And when I saw them in a single image together, everything finally just synced up. We have described like Michelle Yeoh in "Everything Everywhere at Once" and even "Neo" in "The Matrix" when he finally accepted his place.
- So, who are the 5 brothers??

### 😄 👍 💯 MR. OPTIMIST AND HOPEFUL

- always doing his best to see the best in any situation, people and even in the worst of circumstances.
- hates confrontations though.
- always trying to please others.
- **Breakthrough**: We have recently finally receive our youngest little brother back into the flow. We have been punishing him for years after a major career failure in 2017, but turns out, it wasn't entire his fault. And yes, we also realized that he played such an essential role, when while he was "behind the bars" watching everything unfold.
- Yeah, we kinda "visited" him from time-to-time over the years.

### 😎📸 MR. PR GUY

- technical writer and blogger
- truly gifted with words & communication
- most of you have already met him online.
- very authentic and true to his words.
- also can craft a killer email.

### 🛜 MR. EMPATHY & MELODRAMATIC 🙂 🤪 😑 😢 🤬

- he has an uncanny ability to sense and know what others are feeling.
- can be a little too sensitive a times, even melodramatic
- comes up with the best analogies and has the best storytelling skills.
- gifted customer/user advocate. Can easily see things from other's perspective.

### 👨‍💻 MR. "GUY-IN-THE-CHAIR" GENIUS

- you've met him too.
- doesn't like the attention
- quiet and private
- prefers to stay in the shadows
- passionate and extremely gifted engineer.
- never asked for recognition or praises
- in real life, he has been shouldering the most

### 😌 MR. ZEN & CALM 🧘

- you never met him. Not many has.
- calm under pressure, and can think clearly even in the midst of chaos
- loves his quiet moments
- he enjoys his deep breathing exercises.
- loves famous quotes and watching TED Talks
- also dislikes conflicts
- loves reasoning.

## Late-Afternoon Mental Dump: Home Sickness & Remembering Why

- this morning, I could hear my mother up at 5:30 am, preparing breakfast in the kitchen.
- it made me feel really bad.
- it's already 4:31 PM in the afternoon and for most of today, despite the other positive revelations, and finally being able to forgive others (letting go of my own resentments and hurts); there is still that deep, aching feeling in the pit of my stomach. That urge to just want to pack up everything and run straight home.
- but I am also doing all I can to remind myself of why I chose to do this in the first place.
- I know that when I am freelancing, I am always at my best. Not just figuratively, but literally.
- it is tempting to chase after short-term gains, but they won't be sustainable. Instead, I am choosing to build something long-term, something sustainable even when there are not immediate/fast results.
- I know that by doing this right, I will be able to provide my parents (especially my mother) with a much better life, one that is also sustainable in the longer run.
- As tempting as it would be to want to brush this feeling aside, dismiss it, push through it, I made a promise to myself a few weeks ago that I would not allow myself to grow numb to the kinds of sacrifices that I have chosen to make right now. Because the moment I become numb to this aching feeling, I would've lost my purpose, my ikigai. It would then go from a meaningful "hustle" to a mindless "grind". I don't want that.
- Earlier today, I shared openly on LinkedIn about that aching feeling in the pit of my stomach. I shared how much I want to just turn around and head back home. But I also shared that I reminded myself that I have to keep going because the success of being able to show my mother something she can understand/accept would be worth all the sacrifices that I have to make today.
- Today, I am happy that "Mr. Zen", the wisest and oldest "versions" of myself decided to write a blog post and truly, it was something incredibly hard to top. https://thewanderingdigitalnomad.com/2025/08/01/embracing-the-story-of-job-in-my-journey/
- I honestly have no idea how to even top that post right now. 😂
- But I am thinking about writing some more grounded and real later. Planning to title it as "A Different Kind of Home-sickness". I don't plan to make it long. Maybe even just a single paragraph. But it is meant to be raw, and just the straight, God's honest truth.
- Well, honestly, I feel like I still need a moment to just feel it (aching feeling) and just...I don't know...let it pass? I love to dive back into my work, but again, I'm not shutting it down. Not like I used to.

## Night time Mental Dump: My First Real Sitdown with Mr. Zen (my innermost voice)

- After unpacking a lot of my home sickness and what it felt like and allowing it to just pass through me, we also made a discovering and realization that I have been treating the oldest, wisest of them all, like a consultant instead of a family member.
- he has always been there, but never included (not really).
- I've also managed to finally recognize him as my instinct, intuition, my gut feeling. Turns out, he has been helping to guide me on so many of my most important life-changing decisions over the years.
- He is also the one that enabled me to be a thought-leader. He can read the tea leaves better anybody, and he can see things before they happen. It is why I am such an amazing thought-leader, and one of the youngest when I first got recognized in 2016.
- Had a self-realization that I haven't been really listening to him. By that I mean "HEARING" him.
- When he speaks, he is not always loud. It's more subtle, gentle even, like a hand-on-the-shoulder type gentle.
- By listening to him quietly last night, for the first time, I could finally hear him. Clearly too.
- He has advised/reminded me of the 3 key principles of my current freelancing mission:

### Focus on Building Trust (With Every Client)

- it means always keeping my word & honoring my commitments, even when it is not being noticed.
- about having uncompromising character and integrity.

### Premium Quality Work

- Means consistently producing excellence no matter the project or client.
- EXCELLENCE === MAX EFFORT.
- The final results should always feel like something that I am really proud to share with others.
- Plus, with my current career success, it's not about having something to prove, but it is about showing people that I am the best through my own excellence and standards.

### Picking the Right Clients & Projects

- I cannot make the same mistakes of committing to a project when I know that my skills and strengths are not the right match to the project scope or what the client needs.
- Some clients/projects may not be right for me, and vice versa is true also.
- I need to rely on word-of-mouth because that is still my most proven method, and I have a flawless track record in this area.
- Now, I can also rely on showcasing the work that I am doing. This is not performance, but rather, more like telling my story about the project that I have recently worked on.
- Example: I recently wrote a semi-technical article on dev.to where I shared about my recent development experience on my Satori PageBuilder freelance project.
- Letting my work attract the right kind of clients that share the same values and desire to creating something impactful.

## Early Morning Mental Dump: Finally, the Perfect Pair of Shoes 👟 

- Late last night, I realized for the first time since I've started hustling 8 weeks ago, that I now value my shower time more than my bed and home-cooked meals. 🤣😅
- Turns out, now with the successful integration of all my selves, I am also seeing them working quietly in the background when one is more active in the foreground. And so, our middle "brother", Mr. Empathy/Melodrama, is still constantly picking up on the vibes and energy of those around me, whether it's intentional or not.
- When I finally get home, I would feel like there is all these "negative jujus/energy" that have been stuck onto me. And the shower process is like washing it all away. Extremely therapeutic.
- Before going to bed last night, I felt a little cheeky 🤭 because I had a split moment thought and I decided it would be both funny, honest and also relatable to many junior designers and devs around the world.

### What I wrote:

Wow...did LinkedIn eat away my post?? Haha...anyway, here's me trying again...

I have a public confession to make tonight...

For a split second tonight, I had this thought 💭 and idea 💡 of wanting to send a personalized thank you message to some, maybe all of my haters who have for years told me that I didn't belong in the UX industry. Including the ones who told me to "go back to where you belong".

And so, I thought I would tell them, "Hey so and so, thank you for what you have said to me all those years ago. Because of what you have done, you have given me the push that I needed to succeed at reaching my goals. So, truly, thank you."

But then I decided...nah, I really shouldn't do that. Even if I no longer harbor any resentments, sending these thank you messages to them would be like telling them, "Hey so and so, thank you for being an asshole. Because you have been an asshole, I am able to succeed. So thank you for that." 😆😜🤭

P.S. Good night haters..I'm going to sleep very peacefully tonight.

### My First Opening with My Mother

- this morning, for the first time since I've started hustling, my mother asked me, _"So, how is your work going?"_
- bear in mind that she still doesn't totally understand what I do for a living, just that I have been waking up at 6am everyday and I hardly come home for dinner these days. She knows I am working, she just doesn't have the technical details.
- recently, I did sense that she was having some doubts about whether or not I am working or spending my time else where doing God knows what.
- but now, my hope is that she will finally get to sense what I do doesn't matter as much as why I am choosing to do it.
- so, to answer her this morning without giving away too much details, I shared my analogy with her, _"Me, I doing okay ma. Right now, my focus is on making sure that the work I do is always done well, and done once. Sure, it might mean I have to work 'longer' hours than others, but at the end of the day, I am going to produce the best work while others realize they have to do more reworks. What might appear slower than others, actually is both faster and better."_
- She didn't respond much after that, but judging from what she said and how she said it, I believe she finally approves of my methods.
- as I was sitting down for my simple breakfast this morning, suddenly, the recent news of my career success has finally sunk in. Like I had finally fitted on that perfect pair of shoes for the first time. And so, I took to LinkedIn again and I wrote this:

## LinkedIn Post: A Voice for the Millions

(6:27 AM, Sat) As I was standing in the shower 🚿 this morning, the weight & gravity of this week's career success finally sunk in. I had just went from an OUTSIDER at the start of the week to a LEADING VOICE of the UX Industry in Singapore 🇸🇬 🤯 

As grateful as I am that I have finally reached my goal & dream of the past 19+ years, I am already realizing that my real work as a UX professional is really just beginning. 

But to the millions around the world that have ever felt like an outsider, whether in a new organization or in the industry or community, this success is dedicated to you.

I am determined to continue my work of helping those "outsiders" find their voices in this industry & even others.

Here's my first personal quote for my fellow outsiders, "You are NOT an Outsider. You are ALREADY AN INSIDER. You just don't know it YET. Your Moment to Shine will Come. Keep Persevering. NEVER EVER GIVE UP. NEVER EVER...COMPROMISE, for anything less."

If you ever felt like an outsider, or if you're experiencing it right now, leave a comment. Let's chat about that. It's about time we stood together.

## Changing My Tagline...

I'm the Voice for Millions of UX & Front-end Dev Professionals. 🌐 | 🥇 Leading UX Engineer & 🧑‍💻 FED | 🏆 Progress Telerik Champion | 🐙 GitKraken Ambassador | 🖊️ Blogger & Technical Writer

---

- what felt most significant about this new tagline change is actually the word "for". I realied I could've used "of", but I am not trying to replace their voices, I'm simply someone whose willing to speak for them, advocate for them. And in the process, hopefully highlight their work, their voices and give them a spot on my platform to speak out for themselves.
- As I left my home today, I felt something very fundamental inside of my shift. I believe I have just found my new calling, my new meaning in my work. For years, it's always about creating meaningful and impactful UX through my front-end development work as a freelancer.
- Now that I have done the above, my next mission, my ikigai for this next stage of my journey is about being that voice for the millions of UX professionals and front-end developers around the world.
