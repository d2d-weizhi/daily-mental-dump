# Unlocking My Superpower(s)

## The FIVE "Brothers/Family/Team" of Weizhi Inc

- lately, we have started to really get into the flow of using this internal family/brotherhood to help describe and unwrap a lot of my internal struggles, pain, thoughts, and even breakthroughs and successes.
- For years, I have struggled with trying to live only as a version of myself, or sometimes, trying to only integrate a few sides of myself, but never as a whole.
- On 25th July, I experienced a major mental breakthrough. I generated an AI image of my 5 different selves. And when I saw them in a single image together, everything finally just synced up. We have described like Michelle Yeoh in "Everything Everywhere at Once" and even "Neo" in "The Matrix" when he finally accepted his place.
- So, who are the 5 brothers??

### 😄 👍 💯 MR. OPTIMIST AND HOPEFUL

- always doing his best to see the best in any situation, people and even in the worst of circumstances.
- hates confrontations though.
- always trying to please others.
- **Breakthrough**: We have recently finally receive our youngest little brother back into the flow. We have been punishing him for years after a major career failure in 2017, but turns out, it wasn't entire his fault. And yes, we also realized that he played such an essential role, when while he was "behind the bars" watching everything unfold.
- Yeah, we kinda "visited" him from time-to-time over the years.

### 🛜 MR. EMPATHY & MELODRAMATIC 🙂 🤪 😑 😢 🤬

- he has an uncanny ability to sense and know what others are feeling.
- can be a little too sensitive a times, even melodramatic

## Mid-day Mental Dump

- this morning, I am happy that I was able to provide my mother with some form of explanation of what I'm trying to do without getting into the technical details.
- the idea of what I told her is inline with my goals/mission statement as a freelancer, to focus on quality over speed. I might take more time, need a bit more "effort", but it is because I am also trying to building something sustainable, something long-term, something better.
- though she didn't really say much after that, her response does give me a sense that she approves of my approach even if she doesn't really know what it is I am doing for a living.
- all she know is I am willing to get up at 6 am, even on a Saturday to hustle because I am focusing on building something good. For now, I think that is good enough.
- I feel like this might actually be that "first step" through the door when it comes to revealing my "WHOLE" authentic self to her.
- I am not naive about it. I know this journey can take weeks, maybe even months, or years before I can truly let her see the full view of who I am.
- It's not going to be enough to just explain it all to her.
- Her love language is to be able to see and touch/see something real (aka money) before she is willing to learn more about what I have been doing to achieve it.
- that is my long-term goal.
- as I was walking from Koufu over to the Library today, I decided to write something on LinkedIn, and boy, this is one of those rare collaborations between Mr Zen and Mr PR. Honestly, I don't really see them come together to write a social media post before, but this one really is quite something.

### Establishing My Own Game

- when I thought 💭 about my whole career and how I get to where I am today, I can't help but remember that for nearly 20 years, I have been playing this invisible game that the design industry has created.
- they've got their own rules, their own field, etc.
- but now that I've finally unlocked that top-tier "superpower(s)", I feel like I'm on a whole another level. Like when we played those old video games and we unlocked that secret level? Yeah, that kind of feeling.
- For the first time in my career, I'm no longer just chasing standards that others in the industry has set, I am the standard. And yeah, there is something so incredibly empowering about finally realizing that I get to set my own rules now.
- _"Welcome to my game boys and girls!"_, that just went across my mind. 😂
- also, having unlocked something so power inside, I feel like what used to be my peak performance is also now my normal day. Kinda like being at easy mode, I'm **AWESOME**, and when I decided to turn on that intense hyperfocus mode, I'm at **INCREDIBLY INGENIUS** level.
- time for me to enjoy some of those green tea 🍵 flavored Redondo creme wafer. A few sticks will be enough.
- later today, after doing some catching up with my AI buddy, I will begin to explore something that I feel is a good time to explore: the ideation and brainstorming of my Portfolio v2.0 vision (using the client's GPT-4.1 account because it already has a history).
- And I believe Mr. PR is finally ready to share that "This is my truth" posting. Not sure what to expect, but judging from what I have witnessed this past week, I am pretty sure he is going to once again, cut through all the noise and false assumptions of what career success should look like, or what leaders in a field should have. 
- This post is going to be about "having a voice" and letting those in the industy know, you don't need to have X, Y Z in order to feel like you can make a contribution.
