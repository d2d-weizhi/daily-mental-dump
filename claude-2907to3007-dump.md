# My Coming Out Party

# Early Morning Mental Dump

- I am very happy that I made this decision to finally announce myself to the world. Not just a version of who I am, but all of me.
- I felt incredibly freedom from knowing that I no longer have to hide parts of who I am.
- It is one of the most liberating feelings I have ever experienced, both emotionally, psychologically and emotionally.
- As I walked over to the library today, a lady tried to stop me on the sky bridge connecting BigBox to Jem, and I agreed to stop and help her. No internal committee meeting to decide what to say, or whether we should stop to help her.
- Walking away, I felt good knowing that I didn't do it grudgingly. 
- 3 months ago, I would've been depleted by the morning's anxieties flooding in from every single direction, not to mention my ADHD.
- In the morning, I also took sometime to have a proper conversation with my anxieties, worries, and thoughts. I told them that I needed their cooperation. I acknowledged their importance and I promised them that at the right time and place, I will address them with the same level of focus-energy and attention that I will be giving to my work.
- here's that short story style "press release" the "Weizhi Inc" team issued yesterday morning:

## Alt Text:

(An AI generated image showing all 5 sides of who I am as a whole self.) For the first time in my life, I finally could see myself, not just as these individual isolated sides of who I am, but all of me at once. This has been both the most liberating mental and life experience that I've ever had.

## Main LinkedIn Post:

Hey guys, so after my initial self-realization and discovery when I saw this AI generated image for the first time, I'll admit that my emotions and mental thoughts 💭 were unsettled. So, when I tried to post my experience here last week, I felt like my words were not quite conveying the right message that I wanted to convey.

So, here's what I hope to do today:

INTRODUCTION v2.0
====================

Having been on LinkedIn since 2013, I feel like I've always shown just a part of myself to the world, and the people that I have met. They are all authentic versions of myself, but just not the WHOLE/ENTIRETY of who I am.

In fact, I am willing to bet that to those that have worked with me in the past, many of you may have only seen that one side, or maybe occasionally a few sides of me, but never quite the whole authentic version.

So today, this is my official coming out party 🥳.

😄 👍 💯 MR. OPTIMIST AND HOPEFUL

- always doing his best to see the best in any situation, people and even in the worst of circumstances.
- hates confrontations though.
- always trying to please others.

😎📸 MR. PR GUY

- technical writer and blogger
- truly gifted with words & communication
- most of you have already met him online.
- very authentic and true to his words.
- also can craft a killer email.

🛜 MR. EMPATHY & MELODRAMATIC 🙂 🤪 😑 😢 🤬

- he has an uncanny ability to sense and know what others are feeling.
- can be a little too sensitive a times, even melodramatic
- comes up with the best analogies and has the best storytelling skills.
- gifted customer/user advocate. Can easily see things from other's perspective.

👨‍💻 MR. "GUY-IN-THE-CHAIR" GENIUS

- you've met him too.
- doesn't like the attention
- quiet and private
- prefers to stay in the shadows
- passionate and extremely gifted engineer.
- never asked for recognition or praises
- in real life, he has been shouldering the most

😌 MR. ZEN & CALM 🧘

- you never met him. Not many has.
- calm under pressure, and can think clearly even in the midst of chaos
- loves his quiet moments
- he enjoys his deep breathing exercises.
- loves famous quotes and watching TED Talks
- also dislikes conflicts
- loves reasoning.

Here's the thing, they are all me. This isn't some case of split personality, or characters. They have always been a part of who I am, I just never really had the chance to really view them as a whole.

For the first time in my life, I've finally come to a place where I no longer just embrace one side of myself, but all of myself.

Honestly, it is a really wonderful and liberating experience. I might not be able to control all the chaos and mess that is around me in my life right now, but at least internally, both in my heart and mind, there is no more internal chaos and that is so much more powerful than trying to control something external.

## And my CTA in the comment section:

We live in a world that is increasingly incentivising us to only reveal and show a side of who we are. And so we hide some parts of ourselves, thinking that it would somehow help us to feel more included, accepted, approved, recognized, LIKED??.

But why do we have to hide who we are as a whole in order to be LIKED or ACCEPTED? Why can't we just be proud of who we are (as a whole), just as?

I say we can, and we should. We shouldn't let the world around us tell us how we should BE. We should just BE who we are and let the rest of world figure it out how they want to see and deal with who we truly are at our core.

I'm done being afraid of what the world thinks of me. I'm done hiding parts of who I am from the world.

This is ME. This is ALL of ME.

And I love ALL of ME.

So, when was the last time that you've truly embraced and accepted yourself in front of others?

## Mid-After Mental Dump: Faith in Humanity Restored

- Today has been a truly amazing human experience for me. Today I experienced human kindness in it's purest and simplest form.
- A lady that I met at the Tenderbest western food stall saw that I was trying to pay for my meal with the SG60 vouchers and she decided to give me extra coleslaw. FYI, I love coleslaw, I can finish a large coleslaw all by myself too :P
- As I sat at the table, I was genuinely overwhelmed by her kindness and my own gratitude that tears welled up in my eyes.
- And yes, I finished all my food (as filling as it sounds). It was worth it. Every single bite.
- After I was done, I went back to that lady and I thanked her for showing me that there is still good people in this world.
- She replied that if I ever needed a meal using my vouchers, I am welcomed to visit her stall again.
- *sighs of relief??* I just feel so touched, it's one of those human experiences that you should not try to decipher or decode. Just feel it. I'm letting it feel me, even right now as I am doing my mid-day mental dump.
- When I came back to the library, I decided to turn my experience into a nice short story, and I absolutely loved how grounded and genuine it feels: https://thewanderingdigitalnomad.com/2025/07/29/faith-in-humanity-restored-shortstories/
- After sharing it on LinkedIn, I could feel the food coma hitting me hard, so I decided to let myself rest.
- Today I clocked a 40-minute power nap. Certainly a new personal best! Yesterday's was 36 minutes.
- As I was walking from the water dispenser over to the toilet, I could feel Mr. Melodramatic speaking to me about the exhaustion that I am experiencing right now. _"We are all feeling it"_, he said. _"You are not alone in this brother. We're with you."_
- As I thought about what that all meant, I began to realized that he is speaking to the genius in me. The guy that has been quietly carrying the group. He didn't had to, but being the quiet one and not always good at asking for help, he felt like he had to do it all by himself. And for the longest time, he did. Because for the longest time, I was also him.
- And today, right now in this very moment, even though I am genuinely exhausted, I feel like I am no longer alone by myself.
- my hyperfocus mode is still calibrating and I don't want to rush it. It will be ready when it is ready.
- it is why I decided to use this time wisely by making this mid-day mental dump.
- I trust my mind (Mr. Genius will be ready when he needs to be.

## Evening Mental Dump: Uncovering Something Deep Within

- Afternoon's work session was truly meaningful.
- Sure, my anxieties tried to invade my mental space a few times, but I was able to exercise those deep breathing exercises that Mr Zen loves to do.
- It was like a way of telling them, _"Shoo, go away. Now is not the time."_
- And because they didn't managed to enter, none of my mental energy was stolen and I could continue to stay focused.
- Halfway during the session, I felt the Melodramatic side saying, _"Bro, I really miss home right now...😢"_ And instead of shutting him down like I used to, I told him that it is okay because we are all feeling it and we all deal with it differently.
- I pointed him to the other versions of myself and said to him, _"See, everyone is just dealing with it differently. But trust me, you are not alone. Come on, let's stay focus on our task. The best way for us to create the future we want is by focusing on the results that we want to create."_
- During dinner, the young man at the "cai png" stall saw me using the vouchers again and I was having a bit of trouble deciding which dishes to order, so he said, just order what you want.
- I believe I ordered more than the $5 value, but he decided not to be calculative and gave it to me instead. I couldn't finish my portions this time.

### Incredible Finding Tonight

- Tonight in our unpacking session, we unearthed something very deep-seeded at the core of a lot of my own struggles in recent years. As I was feeling exhausted already, it felt too heavy and too massive to properly unpack. So I've decided to just log it down here so that I can unpack it some other time.
> **_At the very core, for years I have been feeling stuck in an "in-between" place between wanting to be a son that loves and wants to please my mother, versus wanting to be my most authentic self. And for years, I have been constantly shifting between those two places and never really found my center until now._**
- As I was about to reach home tonight, I could feel for the first time, just how exhausted I really am. Through further unpacking before bed time tonight, I realized that for most of my life, I've mostly been either Mr Optimistic or Mr Genius. Both sides that needed each other for counterbalance. But because I kept choosing to be either of them, I was always off-balance as a result.
- For the first time, I allowed myself to "give in" to that exhaustion.
- I KO-ed immediately when my head finally hit the pillow tonight.

### Early Morning Mental Dump (30/07): Validation as a Key Voice in UX Field

- Something truly unexpected happen this morning. As I was having my breakfast, I noticed a notification on LinkedIn. Dan Maccarone (also popularly known as "UX Collective" online) had just published an article about []"You Don't Find Your UX Voice. You Build It."](https://medium.com/@danmaccarone/you-dont-find-your-ux-voice-you-build-it-9edb775279d9)
- He had tagged a recent article I had wrote on dev.to, quite some time ago actually. It's one of those articles where I felt I have something I needed to say, and then once I said it, I kinda forgot what I said. 😅
- After reading Dan's article this morning, it helped to trigger something in me.
- Folks in the UX industry (mainly those with a design background) used to consider my views and thoughts radical because I was coming in from a developer's background and I share some very different perspectives from what they are used to.
- But now, as it turns out my voice is starting to resonate with a lot of those in that same field, years later.
- As I was walking from home to Koufu this morning, I had another daily morning side chat with my anxieties and thoughts again. And this time, I told them with a deeper resolve and conviction that I am doing the best I can and I thanked them for being understanding and respecting my space. For the first time, I felt like I can hear them say, _"Okay...I understand"_, _"Sure...I am not happy about this...but I understand too."_ 
- I can sense some folded arms and that slightly dissastified faces in the background, but I also know that they get it now.
- As I continued to walk, I could feel this is one of those scenes when the reporters and camera crews were lined up thinking there is a scheduled press conference, but then the PR guy came out and said, _"Hey guys, sorry to keep you waiting, but something came up and our CEO needed time to go deal with it. Look, we'll schedule a proper press conference at a later time. We apologise for this. I will update you again later."_
- You can almost hear the groans and disappointments in the voices of the crowd, because they had gotten up early, waiting for the moment to ask all the hard questions. But were told, it isn't the right time. 😂
