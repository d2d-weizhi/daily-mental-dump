# Weekend Hustle

It took me a while this morning before I finally got out of the house. While I was glad that it rained last night (which made it easier to sleep), it also make the walk this morning humid and sticky.

I went over to NTUC to get some sushi this morning, bought a Meiji Melon Milk, and Rolondo's Wafer Biscuits. I forgot that that SG60 supermarket vouchers had a minimum value of S$10. So I ended up using the S$20 one because I didn't want to leave my things unattended for too long.

I also made the decision to blog about my thoughts ðŸ’­ this morning, and I genuinely liked what I have written because it is also authentic and genuine.

## What are My Plans for Today?

- I want to focus on getting the Assignments page of AceIt! Dashboard implemented.
- I want to add in the missing `tags` table and then `assignment_tags` and `task_tags`.
- Populate the tables with relevant data.
- Start building those state interfaces and the state managers.
- If there is time today, link up the UI with Supabase backend.

## Post-Lunch Reflections ðŸ’­

- during lunch today, sitting there in that foodcourt in the midst of a busy Saturday lunch crowd, I nearly started to cry.
- but I also held back because I know that even if it draws sympathy by those strangers around me, it won't do anything to reeally help me get to my goals ðŸŽ¯ any faster.
- But I also acknowledge that this is the empathy, sensitive side of who I am. I miss spending time at home on the weekend, closer to my parents.
- Instead, I am out here, hustling, doing all that I can to make life better, not just for myself, but also for them.
- As I walked back to the library, I reminded myself that this desire/need to succeed is not about serving my own ego or pride. This is not just about me anymore. This is about us.
- I know the fastest way for me to reach my goal is to focus on doing the things that I'm most passionate about and then excelling at them.

## Mid-day Thoughts & Reflections

- why do I feel guilty for putting aside my anxieties and worries and commitments? It's not like I can deal with them directly right now.
- if I have to use the analogy of an overzealous news reporter standing outside the door, it's like the bouncer is keeping her and the rest of my anxieties out, but I can still hear them in the background as I try to focus on what I can control and do.
- I know that this peace and calm is genuine. It is internal.
- I also know that just because I've learned to accept myself as whole, my troubles and challenges won't just disappear. And that is also okay.
- I'm glad I bought the Redondo Creme Wafers as snack. Sinful, but a worthy snack to keep my going during my weekend hustling. Time to enjoy 1 or 2 sticks ðŸ˜œ.
