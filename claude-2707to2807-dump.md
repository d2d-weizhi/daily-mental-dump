# Mental Management

## Pre-lunch Mental Dump

- Learned that Koufu doesn't operate on Sundays, so I decided to find one of those tables in the basement of Jem and I just started my day there.
- I did some emotional unpacking this morning with claude and it was fruitful. We addressed some of what I've been experiencing lately and I provided a detailed re-cap.
- I then spend about 15 minutes planning my tasks for today, which as it turns out, was the most meaningful 15 minutes of planning I've ever had. Why? Because everything felt so clear for the first time.
- When I was at the library, it felt really easy to just get into that "quiet hyperfocus" zone. Compared to the past, I've always needed a bit of time to get into it. And whenever I would get slightly distracted, it would also be a little difficult to get back into the flow again.
- It is so apt to describe that previous experience as "brute-force" hyperfocus.
- What I have started experiencing since Friday is this crystal clear, hyperfocus. It is absolutely intense too. But everything is sharp, and I could see all the details like a very powerful DSLR camera taking a macro shot.
- I wrote about this last night in my blog: https://thewanderingdigitalnomad.com/2025/07/26/hyperfocus-the-workings-of-a-quiet-mind/
- right before I went for lunch, I had this brief moment where I was trying to solve a tricky issue and in that split moment, my brain blanked out. I immediately knew what was happening (like the bouncer seeing a reporter trying to jump the line).
- I told that thought, _"Stop. Not now. I really want to focus on solving this issue first. You'll need to wait for your turn (time)."_

## Post-Lunch

- I'm acknowledging my financial commitments that haven't been met.
- I'm acknowledging that they are important.
- But I am also reminding myself that there is no way for me to directly meet their demands right now.
- Yes, I have been buying time. I don't like it, but it is true.
- Right now, the only thing I can truly control is my portfolio work.
- Yes, my freelance client's dev team did send me some feedbacks on Friday to look at.
- But I am choosing to give some priority and time to my own portfolio work because as much as I am dedicated to this client, I also need more work and income.
- Right now, staying true to myself and being authentic, the most effective way for me to put myself out there is to showcase what I can do.
- I don't want to write about "I'm going to do this...", "I am working on that...". 
- I just want to do it. And then show them.
- The very same way that I worked on Satori PageBuilder for 5 weeks and then wrote an article about it. Results.
- I choose to recognize all of my worries and concerns. I'm just refusing to allow them to hijack my focus and agenda anymore.
- They will have their time (when I am ready to face them and deal with them properly).

## Lost Track of Time (Again!!)

- Yeah yeah, I know. But hey, at least I made some pretty awesome progress this afternoon.
- Geez, I think I went from 2pm non-stop all the way till 7pm.
- 5 hours might not seem like much in dev-hours, but when I think about the amount of work (most importantly, the quality), I am genuinely quite impressed with how much I was able to accomplish in 5 hours. On top of using a slow Raspberry Pi 4.
- It is truly nice to be able to just stay fully present while I work. Like, in spite of all the potential anxieties and worries and genuine concerns, I was able to stay fully **IN THE ZONE** today.
- Looking forward to my unpacking session before I get my haircut this evening.
- Gotta be honest, I am looking forward to dinner tonight at home, but I'm not sure I am ready to go home and face those responsibilities, stressors and ...yeah.. *deep breathes*
- Anyway, I can only choose to focus on the things I can control. And maybe that is really the best I can do right now. It has to be enough.
