# Mid-day Mental Dump: Managing My Self-Doubts & Anxieties

- I genuinely enjoyed a good morning session as I crafted the best email responses I have ever written as a freelancer.
- I realized that this was me all along, the key difference being, the PR side of me is finally in sync with the Genius side.
- Reading that email back, I almost could not recognize myself in it. There was so much clarity and confidence oozing out of the different sections.
- That felt truly amazing.
- I then went for a nice lunch break.
- During lunch, while I was ordering my food, the young man at the cai png stall recognized me using my SG60 vouchers, and he decided to grab more of the ingredients that I wanted.
- While I was eating, I had a moment where my anxieties and self-doubts tried to interrupt my meal, and I decided to respond to it by setting up some clear boundaries.
- I even wrote a nice short story to illustrate what I have experienced: https://thewanderingdigitalnomad.com/2025/07/28/heres-how-ive-learned-to-manage-my-self-doubts-and-anxieties-shorts/
- I also shared my experience on LinkedIn, showing a different side of me, one that is always part of who I am and I am fully embracing them.
- Coming back to the library, I acknowledged how exhausted I am, coupled with the food coma.
- I KO-ed for a full 36 minutes (even though there were two noisy students sitting beside me). I believe I was genuinely exhausted after 7 weeks of hustling.
- This is my power nap personal best timing. ðŸ˜œ
- After walking to the toilet to wash my face and glasses, on my way back, there was a split moment when my anxiety got through and tried to remind me about the call that is happening later today. A reminder of the uncertainty, as if to throw me off-balance again.
- I responded by saying, _"I am aware of the call later. I am not looking forward to it. Or what news it might bring. But for now, I need to focus on my work. It needs my focus right now. We'll deal with the call when it comes."_
- I'm ready to step back into my full quiet hyperfocus mode again.
