# Mid-day Mental Dump: Managing My Self-Doubts & Anxieties

- I genuinely enjoyed a good morning session as I crafted the best email responses I have ever written as a freelancer.
- I realized that this was me all along, the key difference being, the PR side of me is finally in sync with the Genius side.
- Reading that email back, I almost could not recognize myself in it. There was so much clarity and confidence oozing out of the different sections.
- That felt truly amazing.
- I then went for a nice lunch break.
- During lunch, while I was ordering my food, the young man at the cai png stall recognized me using my SG60 vouchers, and he decided to grab more of the ingredients that I wanted.
- While I was eating, I had a moment where my anxieties and self-doubts tried to interrupt my meal, and I decided to respond to it by setting up some clear boundaries.
- I even wrote a nice short story to illustrate what I have experienced: https://thewanderingdigitalnomad.com/2025/07/28/heres-how-ive-learned-to-manage-my-self-doubts-and-anxieties-shorts/
- I also shared my experience on LinkedIn, showing a different side of me, one that is always part of who I am and I am fully embracing them.
- Coming back to the library, I acknowledged how exhausted I am, coupled with the food coma.
- I KO-ed for a full 36 minutes (even though there were two noisy students sitting beside me). I believe I was genuinely exhausted after 7 weeks of hustling.
- This is my power nap personal best timing. ðŸ˜œ
- After walking to the toilet to wash my face and glasses, on my way back, there was a split moment when my anxiety got through and tried to remind me about the call that is happening later today. A reminder of the uncertainty, as if to throw me off-balance again.
- I responded by saying, _"I am aware of the call later. I am not looking forward to it. Or what news it might bring. But for now, I need to focus on my work. It needs my focus right now. We'll deal with the call when it comes."_
- I'm ready to step back into my full quiet hyperfocus mode again.

## Evening Mental Dump: Slow, but Purposeful

- Yesterday, I called my creditor after I finished my objectives for the day.
- I created boundaries and when the time was right, I gave the attention that I promised.
- I didn't quite get the response I had hoped, but I know that at least I had the courage to face it head on.
- The creditor's response felt like a _"stay of execution"_ ðŸ˜…
- Told myself that I have done the best I can, and that is all anybody can do in a similar situation.
- We unpacked a lot yesterday evening, we dug deep too.
- We revisited my initial feelings of seeing that AI generated image of the 5 individual versions of myself sitting together around a table at Koufu in the morning (Last Friday morning).
- The first time I realized I was looking at all of ME. The first I saw the WHOLE me and not just a side of myself.
- Yesterday was the first time that I felt like I still have mental energy left to dissect and unpack my emotions and thoughts ðŸ’¬. 6 months ago, I would've been totally depleted by the same time yesterday.
- We talked about how my quiet hyperfocus now is like taking a satellite imagery. Extremely high intensity, super sharp and with great detail. But at the same time, I also needed time to recalibrate and recharge. 
- What used to be considered high intensity focus doesn't take 100% of my mental energy anymore. More like 50-60%, so I do have some left in my mental bank if I need to do some "mental dumps".
- Glad my mother didn't asked me about my financial commitments last night, I got some peace
- As I stood in the shower ðŸš¿, it also dawn on me how exhausted I really am. I forgot to turn on the heater and I was too lazy and tired to care, so I just took a cold shower instead.
- Felt surprisingly refreshing after (still totally exhausted) ðŸ¥± 
- Of all the things we unpacked last night two things stood out the most to me:

**Strategic Growth:** 
- When I said no to myself regarding the two freelance opportunities I saw online, I was protecting both my credibility and the trust that Adrian (my only freelance client now) has in me. I wrote about it here: https://thewanderingdigitalnomad.com/2025/07/28/why-i-said-no-to-myself-shorts/

**Slow, But Right Direction**: 
- When we described the scene of the persistent reporter staying late just to catch me as I left, she asked, _"Isn't it risky to place everything you have and bet it on Adrian? I mean, there are no guarantees it might lead to more work right? I mean, surely you can promise that."_
- In my response to that I said, _"Look, you're absolutely right. I can't promise you that. But just the same way as you made the decision to stay late to chase after me with another question, there was no guarantee that you might actually catch me right? My point being, sometimes, we only have that ONE chance, that ONE opportunity. And it's is really all we've got. And it's down to us to either make the best of the one we do have, or distract ourselves and risk losing everything that we're trying to get our hands on. Miss, I have learned the hard way that sometimes, having one good, solid opportunity is better than not having anything at all."_

## Early Post-Morning Dump

- My mother finally decided to ask me again about my finances and when I will be giving her that monthly allowance that is still due.
- I told her that I will take care of it the moment that I can (and it is 100% true).
- during my morning walk over to Koufu, I took a moment to speak to my anxieties and worries and thoughts.
- I said, _"Hey guys, look, I know how important you are. And honestly, you guys deserve my fullest attention and focus, the same way that my work does. But I need you to cooperate with me today. Look, I know that I only have one client, one project right now. I know it is risky, me putting all I have into him. I know there are no guarantees, no promises. But I also know that when we only have this ONE good thing, we have to make the most, the best of it. We've done it before, remember? So, I really need you all to trust me that I am doing everything I can to address these commitments. And yes, I am choosing to take a different approach this time. No more rushed, rash short-term measures. Instead I am doing everything that I can to build a more long-term sustainable income. But that takes some time. We might not be able to see or experience it right now, but trust me, I know it will be worth it. So, please, when I want to focus on my tasks for today, I ask that you do not interrupt my focus. When I am ready, I promise you, I will give you all the energy and focus that you deserve."_
