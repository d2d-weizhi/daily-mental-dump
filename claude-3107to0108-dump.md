## Mid-day Mental Dump: Finally Stepping Into Myself

- this morning, I shared another LinkedIn post before I left the house, making the most recent two postings tied to "gratitude" as I took the time to thank all of those people that have been helping me for the past 19+ years.
- as I thought more about why I decided to share those updates, it began to dawn upon me that this was strategic empathy. I know that with my new recognition, some haters are going to think, _"See, how he is going to act all high and mighty like he is right all along."_
- instead, by continuing to share my gratitude, I have shown them that I am acutely aware that I would not have made it here without the help of so many people. Yes, including some of those that were very nice, but were willing to speak the harshest truths when it mattered the most.
- I went to NTUC this morning to get some necessities, like Salonpas, new umbrella, and yes, there is a Sushi Platter (although I suspected they were leftovers)
- Still, eating those sushis felt extremely rewarding.
- After returning to Koufu, I received a call from my creditor and she told me that the bank didn't recall my debt (no defaulting) and so I had bought myself some relief and time.
- I felt like a very heavy boulder had just been lifted from my shoulders. I finally felt a **HUGE SIGH OF RELIEF**.

### From "What Now?" to "Legacy Roadmap"

- This morning, we managed to finish unpack a thought that I was having yesterday evening, _"Now that I've receive this incredible recognition, what next? How do I take what I have just accomplished and turn it into something real?"_
- We managed to break it down into **THREE** rather simple mission objectives:
  - **Business as Usual**: This goal is truly simple, to continue doing the things that I've already been doing for the past 20 odd years. For me, nothing has changed. I am still the same person who has turned what I believed in into results that others can witness now. So, this is just me **leading by example**. Nothing more.
  - **Lifting Others Up**: This goal is referring to the other UX designers and front-end developers in the industry. Now that I have a leading voice, I find that the best way for me to use it is to occasionally step aside and let another designer/developer say a few words (figure of speech). This is about highlighting their works, mentoring and coaching them.
  - **Continue Speaking Out**: One of the most powerful things I have is my ability to speak out with greater authority and actually command respect from the community. When I speak out, people are silenced and they listen. And I am never afraid to challenge brands, products, practices that I do not agree with. So, I have to keep speaking out because I am no longer just speaking out for my own beliefs, I am also speaking out on behalf of those that might not yet have their own voice/platform/ability to.
- On the income front, we've identified **TWO** immediate solutions/updates:
  - **Increasing my Hourly Rates as a Freelancer**: With this new global recognition, I can finally go back to commanding that **S$125 hourly rates** like I used to when I was at my peak as a freelancer. In fact, actually, I believe I can even ask for more. So, I'm now officially setting it at **S$150 an hour** (because I know that some clients might want to negotiate down).
  - **Paid Coaching/Mentoring**: This is another part that I have been wanting to do for years, but because I was considered an outsider for so long, I was afraid to charge those fees. And so, for years, I just kept on providing free mentoring & coaching. Well, now it is officially time for me to start charging for my hours. But, I do want to offer that first free sit down because this is about giving them a chance to be heard. And I want to really listen to them before we decide if they want more.
