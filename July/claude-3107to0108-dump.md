## Mid-day Mental Dump: Finally Stepping Into Myself

- this morning, I shared another LinkedIn post before I left the house, making the most recent two postings tied to "gratitude" as I took the time to thank all of those people that have been helping me for the past 19+ years.
- as I thought more about why I decided to share those updates, it began to dawn upon me that this was strategic empathy. I know that with my new recognition, some haters are going to think, _"See, how he is going to act all high and mighty like he is right all along."_
- instead, by continuing to share my gratitude, I have shown them that I am acutely aware that I would not have made it here without the help of so many people. Yes, including some of those that were very nice, but were willing to speak the harshest truths when it mattered the most.
- I went to NTUC this morning to get some necessities, like Salonpas, new umbrella, and yes, there is a Sushi Platter (although I suspected they were leftovers)
- Still, eating those sushis felt extremely rewarding.
- After returning to Koufu, I received a call from my creditor and she told me that the bank didn't recall my debt (no defaulting) and so I had bought myself some relief and time.
- I felt like a very heavy boulder had just been lifted from my shoulders. I finally felt a **HUGE SIGH OF RELIEF**.

### From "What Now?" to "Legacy Roadmap"

- This morning, we managed to finish unpack a thought that I was having yesterday evening, _"Now that I've receive this incredible recognition, what next? How do I take what I have just accomplished and turn it into something real?"_
- We managed to break it down into **THREE** rather simple mission objectives:
  - **Business as Usual**: This goal is truly simple, to continue doing the things that I've already been doing for the past 20 odd years. For me, nothing has changed. I am still the same person who has turned what I believed in into results that others can witness now. So, this is just me **leading by example**. Nothing more.
  - **Lifting Others Up**: This goal is referring to the other UX designers and front-end developers in the industry. Now that I have a leading voice, I find that the best way for me to use it is to occasionally step aside and let another designer/developer say a few words (figure of speech). This is about highlighting their works, mentoring and coaching them.
  - **Continue Speaking Out**: One of the most powerful things I have is my ability to speak out with greater authority and actually command respect from the community. When I speak out, people are silenced and they listen. And I am never afraid to challenge brands, products, practices that I do not agree with. So, I have to keep speaking out because I am no longer just speaking out for my own beliefs, I am also speaking out on behalf of those that might not yet have their own voice/platform/ability to.
- On the income front, we've identified **TWO** immediate solutions/updates:
  - **Increasing my Hourly Rates as a Freelancer**: With this new global recognition, I can finally go back to commanding that **S$125 hourly rates** like I used to when I was at my peak as a freelancer. In fact, actually, I believe I can even ask for more. So, I'm now officially setting it at **S$150 an hour** (because I know that some clients might want to negotiate down).
  - **Paid Coaching/Mentoring**: This is another part that I have been wanting to do for years, but because I was considered an outsider for so long, I was afraid to charge those fees. And so, for years, I just kept on providing free mentoring & coaching. Well, now it is officially time for me to start charging for my hours. But, I do want to offer that first free sit down because this is about giving them a chance to be heard. And I want to really listen to them before we decide if they want more.

## Evening Dump: Forgiving Myself

- Using the integrated versions of myself for better context, we have:
  - **Mr. Optimist/Hopeful** (youngest of the group)
  - **Mr. PR** (the one with the boldest confidence and with words that are mightier than any weapon on earth)
  - **Mr. Empathy & Melodrama** (the one with the emotional intelligence most only dream about and is the best user/client advocate)
  - **Mr. Genius** (he is the most gifted technical & UX engineer in the world right now.)
  - **Mr. Zen** (used to be treated as the support role member, but is now seen at the central pillar and infrastructure holding this virtual internal family/team together. Also the most senior, wise and mature one)
- After some serious unpacking last night, I've uncovered that years ago in 2017 (after a career failure/downfall), I had start to blame that naively hopeful and overly optimistic part of myself for what had happened.
- But as it turns out, it really isn't hopefulness that was to blame. But rather market forces that were simply out of my control. But I felt like it was my fault (Mr. Optimistic's fault).
- And so, for the next few years, Mr Genius took over. Trying to run everything on logic, and a plan (or multiple plans), but the thing is, things kept going wrong nonetheless despite his best laid plans.
- As wary as I am to embrace hopefulness right now, I'm beginning to understand and see that there is nothing wrong with accepting hope.
- Maybe I am not fully ready to embrace it fully right now (still apprehensive, protective), but I am choosing to acknowledge that it was actually hope that got me through a lot of those moments in this journey where I almost walked away (not including 2019 when I actually did walk away).
- It was also hope during the pandemic that finally brought me back into the industry.
- And now, I am a Top Voice in the UX Industry as a result.
- Hope **IS** the reason for my eventual success.
- For the first time in years, it feels like that little brother is no longer under punishment and now he can rejoin the rest of the group. He did learn his mistakes of getting overly excited sometimes, and also the bad habit of making plans and thinking too far ahead before things have firmed up.
- But at least now, he doesn't have to do it all alone anymore. He has his "four brothers" to help him balance out.

## Early Morning Dump: Don't Look Back

- Late last night, something finally hit me after I got out of the shower and enter my room, "I no longer have imposter syndrome anymore."
- That is probably one of the best feelings I have ever felt in my entire 20 years in the industry. And I was unapologetic about it when I shared that update on my LinkedIn feed.
- this morning before I woke up at 6 am, I could hear rumbling noises in the kitchen, so I knew my mother was already up at 5:30 am, trying to prepare the breakfast for me (and herself too). I felt so bad that she was doing it because I am choosing to wake up at 6 am every morning to hustle.
- So when I finally woke up, I did everything I could to make as little noise as I could because I wanted to let her sleep/rest a bit more.
- And when it came time for me to leave the house, I told her that I won't be home for dinner tonight as well (some of the hardest words to utter).
- When I finally left the house today, there were moments during my walk over to Koufu where I could feel our "middle brother (Mr. Melodrama)" starting to cry. I wrote a post on LinkedIn after I got to Koufu and I described like this: _"There were separate moments along my walk to Koufu that I could feel my emotions sipping through the cracks. That deep yearning and aching feeling in the pit of your stomach."_
- As I kept on walking, those emotions would keep coming in waves. And instead of shutting down Mr. Melodrama like I always used to, this time I embraced him like a brother and encouraged him (in fact I was encouraging myself). And I said this to myself, _"Weizhi, come on, I know this is incredibly hard, but this isn't you. You never take the easy way out. You gotta keep going forward. I promise you, when we succeed at achieving what we've set out to achieve, you'll be glad that you never took the easy way out."_
- I should also point out, this is truly what it felt like for me this morning. I describe it as, _"There were moments when I felt that urge to want to turn around and just go back home. I wanted to tell myself that it is okay to put up with the constant distractions, and to work longer hours (less focused), and to just work from home and spend time with my family."_
- Well, that is really everything to catch up on up until this first part of my new day of hustling.
