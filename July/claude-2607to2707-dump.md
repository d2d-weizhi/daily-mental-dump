# Weekend Hustle

It took me a while this morning before I finally got out of the house. While I was glad that it rained last night (which made it easier to sleep), it also make the walk this morning humid and sticky.

I went over to NTUC to get some sushi this morning, bought a Meiji Melon Milk, and Rolondo's Wafer Biscuits. I forgot that that SG60 supermarket vouchers had a minimum value of S$10. So I ended up using the S$20 one because I didn't want to leave my things unattended for too long.

I also made the decision to blog about my thoughts ðŸ’­ this morning, and I genuinely liked what I have written because it is also authentic and genuine.

## What are My Plans for Today?

- I want to focus on getting the Assignments page of AceIt! Dashboard implemented.
- I want to add in the missing `tags` table and then `assignment_tags` and `task_tags`.
- Populate the tables with relevant data.
- Start building those state interfaces and the state managers.
- If there is time today, link up the UI with Supabase backend.

## Post-Lunch Reflections ðŸ’­

- during lunch today, sitting there in that foodcourt in the midst of a busy Saturday lunch crowd, I nearly started to cry.
- but I also held back because I know that even if it draws sympathy by those strangers around me, it won't do anything to reeally help me get to my goals ðŸŽ¯ any faster.
- But I also acknowledge that this is the empathy, sensitive side of who I am. I miss spending time at home on the weekend, closer to my parents.
- Instead, I am out here, hustling, doing all that I can to make life better, not just for myself, but also for them.
- As I walked back to the library, I reminded myself that this desire/need to succeed is not about serving my own ego or pride. This is not just about me anymore. This is about us.
- I know the fastest way for me to reach my goal is to focus on doing the things that I'm most passionate about and then excelling at them.

## Mid-day Thoughts & Reflections

- why do I feel guilty for putting aside my anxieties and worries and commitments? It's not like I can deal with them directly right now.
- if I have to use the analogy of an overzealous news reporter standing outside the door, it's like the bouncer is keeping her and the rest of my anxieties out, but I can still hear them in the background as I try to focus on what I can control and do.
- I know that this peace and calm is genuine. It is internal.
- I also know that just because I've learned to accept myself as whole, my troubles and challenges won't just disappear. And that is also okay.
- I'm glad I bought the Redondo Creme Wafers as snack. Sinful, but a worthy snack to keep my going during my weekend hustling. Time to enjoy 1 or 2 sticks ðŸ˜œ. 

## This Week So Far

As I begin to prepare for another Sunday hustle, I want to take a moment to sit and consolidate all the key highlights of this pretty amazing week. Not because of what happened around me, but what happened with me.

- Began my first lull period as a freelancer since my reentry into the industry in 2022.
- Just finished working on v1.0 of Satori PageBuilder, my first official freelance project since being back: https://dev.to/d2d_weizhi/from-user-to-builder-how-i-built-a-pagebuilder-in-5-weeks-2oif
- Now more part-time school, so less distraction and focus-splitting since.
- 3 weeeks ago, I made a conscious decision to focus on freelancing full-time because I trusted my gut knowing that this is the best way for me to reach my fullest potential.
- Most importantly, the reason I have been hustling for the past 7 weeks is so that I can provide a better future and life for my parents: https://thewanderingdigitalnomad.com/2025/07/24/hustling-shorts/
- Over the past few days, we have unpacked a lot, both mentally, emotionally and psychologically.
- I have discovered and learned that all these years of incredible hard times hasn't just made me cold, calcuated and hard. Instead, they have given me different layers of character.
- They even revealed to me the person that I am, not just as individual, isolated versions of myself (not split personality like in movies ðŸ˜…), but rather, seeing myself as a whole.

    <figcaption>AI Generated images rarely ever get it right. But when they do, it is so mind-blowing ðŸ¤¯. Seeing this image on Friday morning made me realized that I was finally seeing myself as a whole for the first time.</figcaption>
</figure>

---

- After I learned to see myself as a whole for the first time, something inside of me clicked. Like a switch that was flipped. Suddenly, all that internal chaos just disappeared.
- I'm not referring to my ADHD or chronic anxiety disorder. They are very much still there, but for the very first time, I feel like there wasn't any internal conflicts anymore.
- I even used the "Everything Everywhere at Once" movie analogy. It's as if the multiverse versions of myself are now finally in sync.
- During my morning walk from home to the Jem mall basement (Koufu foodcourt don't open on Sundays), I also thought ðŸ’­ about why I felt such a strong relation to the story of Neo within The Matrix movie.
- Maybe it is because I've been spending most of my life trying to be that split versions of myself. Stuck in a place/environment where I feel like I have to conform to the expectations, perceptions and desires of my mother (asian, singaporean and chinese).
- At the same time, I've always had this feeling inside me that I was meant for something different. Something that she wouldn't approve of or agree with.
- (My Red Pill ðŸ’Š Moment) 10 years ago, I finally made that conscious decision to pursue my passion in UX and front-end engineering. Since then, I felt cut off. No moral support, nothing. I've been emotionally, psychologically, and mentally on my own.
- (My "He's the ONE!" Moment) This happened two days ago on Friday morning. That moment of clarity. That moment when I could finally see everything so clear.
- And then last night I wrote this on my blog: https://thewanderingdigitalnomad.com/2025/07/26/hyperfocus-the-workings-of-a-quiet-mind/

- When I woke up this morning and saw that the sky wasn't even bright yet, somehow I feel pleased with myself for having the discipline and perseverance to get up and get back to my hustle.
- At the same time, I do wish things didn't have to be this way.

## Key Emotional Unpacking

- I opened up for the first time that about the moment where I told in the showers sometimes and I would say it under my breath, _"I wish I could just tell her what I am really doing. I wish I could just tell her the truth."_
- I have been carrying it with me on the inside for the past two years plus since 2022.
- I admitted that I lied in a LinkedIn post about what happened between my mother and me on Saturday morning, and then I decided to just make the correction. No "trying to explain myself". I just did it. Why? Because I know it is the right thing to do.
- I remembered why as a freelancer at my peak, I was able to command a single contract of S$48K. It might have only happened once, but it was a sign, a preview, a taste of what I am truly capable of.
- My integrity, character, grit and authenticity are my greatest superpowers. They are all the reasons why I will succeed, not just to rebuild/relive past glories, but to do it better this time.

## Bonus Stuff

- I was surprised when I noticed that my client was also on dev.to and he liked a recent critic article that I had written about Lovable: https://dev.to/d2d_weizhi/production-ready-really-or-just-copious-amounts-of-glue-duct-tape-the-lovable-reality-check-2d99
- As it turns out, I haven't lost my technical writing. It was just dormant, like ambers that needed fanning. And with the right topic and something that I was passionate about, that fire ðŸ”¥ deep inside my pit has been lit once again.
